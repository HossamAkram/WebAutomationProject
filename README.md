## Web Automation Project

### Overview

Test Automation for a demo website using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java**, based on **Maven** and **TestNG**.

* Implements Fluent **Page Object Model (POM)** for structuring test scripts.
* Automates a basic user flow including navigation and interactions.
* Manages test data using external files for flexibility.
* Generates detailed test reports with logs and screenshots via **Allure**.
* Supports local execution and remote execution on Selenium Grid.

### Features

#### Structure of "main" Folder

* Implements Page Object Model (POM) with reusable page components.
* Uses locators and actions to interact with web elements efficiently.

#### Structure of "test" Folder

* Includes Base Test Class to manage test setup and teardown.
* Uses annotations for configuring browser sessions.
* Ensures tests start from a clean state by resetting the session per test.

#### Assertions

* Hard assertions ensure critical checkpoints are met before proceeding.
* Soft assertions allow validations within the test without stopping execution.

#### Reporting

* Generates detailed test reports with steps and screenshots.
* Captures failure details including screenshots and logs.

#### Configurations

* Reads global variables and settings from a properties file.
* Supports different execution types (local, remote).
* Allows configuring browser types (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

#### Test Data Management

* Uses external JSON files to store test data.
* Supports static data storage (messages, page titles, credentials).
* Allows updating test data dynamically for future test runs.

### Prerequisites

* Install Java (JDK 11+ recommended).
* Install an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
* Install Maven (if not bundled with your IDE).
* Ensure necessary WebDriver binaries are available (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.).
* Install Docker (for remote execution).

### Running the Tests Using an IDE

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Navigate to `src/test/java/org/project/tests/`.
3. Open the test class you want to execute.
4. Right-click inside the class and select **Run 'ClassName'**.

### Running on Selenium Grid (Remote Execution)

1. Install Docker.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `docker-compose_selenium4.yml`.
3. Start the Grid:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose_selenium4.yml up
   ```
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:4444/ui` to view the Selenium Grid.
5. Navigate to the **Sessions** tab and click the video icon to see test execution live.
6. Run the tests with execution.type=Remote in configuration.properties.
